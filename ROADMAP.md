### Bugs
- In ToA, Jaq didn't get +4 to hit or +2 damage with his crossbow. Weird.
- In ToA, the stacked Bless didn't do anything

### Short Term Goals
- Initiative rolls (all NPC for gm)
- Don't depend on 5e ruleset
- Add a way to 'fave' something, so it appears at the top of the actions list
- Sort the actions list by name
- Check for actions of unequipped items. Jon reported them in the list.
- Have stacked commands wait for rolls so damage can be conditional
  
### Long term ideas
- Don't target tokens outside of LOS when LOS is enabled (?)
- Is there a way to include action shortcuts in the /cb a output?

- Target based on the last shape drawn (50% within the shape)
- Add a way to reset the combat tracker after an encounter
- Undo damage?
